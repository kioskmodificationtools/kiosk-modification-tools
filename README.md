# kiosk-modification-tools
A suite of tools to assist with the modification of kiosk machines.

Kiosk Modification Tools (KMT) allows users to perform modifications on a wide variety of kiosks (provided that they have web access). KMT provides a suite of operations both advanced and simple, allowing you as many options as possible to achieve your team's goals. KMT is user- and permission-agnostic, as we strive to provide our services to all people, not just those with ownership and possession of certain systems. KMT is under constant development, so if you or your team have proposed improvements, please don't hesitate to contact us at `kioskmodificationtools@gmail.com`.
